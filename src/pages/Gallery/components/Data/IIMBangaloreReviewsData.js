          " The admission process started off with writing the CAT (Common Admission Test), which is admissible to all students with an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree. Once that is qualified, there is a detailed admission form that needs to be filled up, including a Statement of Purpose and recommendations. This is then followed by a Writing Assessment (WAT) and Personal Interview (PI).",

         "The course curriculum is very comprehensive and builds the foundations of management with subjects like Marketing, Operations, Organization Behaviour, Statistics, Economics, etc., during the first three terms. In the third term, we are also given the option to choose electives. The second year is completely elective-based and allows students to pursue courses of their interest. The faculty: student ratio is very high which allows students to easily have one on one interactions with the faculty. All faculty members are highly qualified and the admin is very particular about following the schedule for classes & exams.",
