            "I know I might sound blunt, but you cannot get into NIT Trichy CSE unless you belong to a reserved category. The expected opening and closing rank for the B.Tech CSE course at NIT Trichy for the academic session 2022 was around 400 to 5300. This year there might be only a slight difference. However, your rank of 10000 has no chance",
